- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Roarster
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in building things in Go, .Net, Javascript and Java. I've built a ton of web apps and am mostly using React at the moment. Also been using Next.js quite a bit lately.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a bit of Go. Nearly my entire career has been spent building web apps so Go is something a bit different for me. Also trying to improve my TypeScript skills - I know enough to be productive but I sometimes feel like I'm lacking the fundamentals.
